 * This program takes a given URL and parses it for IMG tags
 * If it finds one it retrieves the URL and adds it to a list, which can then be displayed in an image panel
 * This program is heavily URL dependent. It will crash on certain URL's, find no images on others and has trouble displaying those it does find. 
 * That is fine as it met the project requirements, and was only needed for very simple tasks.
