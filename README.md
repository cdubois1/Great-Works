# Great-Works
Please note many of these programs were written for school projects with specific guidelines. The final product may not be robust, efficient, or even entirely functional as that was not the goal.
Other files are snippets from personal projects, not meant to be complete or whole. The purpose of this is simply to provide a window into my coding capabilities and style. 
Thank you for your consideration.
